# Google AI Hackathon 2025 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code MUST adhere to industry best practices with zero tolerance for technical debt accumulation. Static analysis tools MUST pass without warnings. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes with focus on readability, maintainability, and adherence to established patterns. Linting and formatting rules are non-negotiable and enforced via pre-commit hooks.

*Rationale: High-quality code reduces debugging time, improves collaboration, and ensures project sustainability throughout the hackathon timeline.*

### II. Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Minimum 80% code coverage required for all features. Unit tests for all business logic, integration tests for API contracts, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced.

*Rationale: Comprehensive testing ensures feature reliability and prevents regressions, critical for hackathon success where rapid iteration is essential.*

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST follow a unified design system with consistent interaction patterns, visual hierarchy, and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). User flows MUST be intuitive and require minimal learning curve. Cross-platform compatibility required where applicable.

*Rationale: Consistent UX reduces user confusion and improves adoption rates, essential for hackathon judging and user feedback.*

### IV. Performance Standards
Response times MUST be under 200ms for API endpoints, under 100ms for UI interactions. Memory usage MUST stay within defined limits. Performance regression tests required for all optimization-sensitive features. Monitoring and alerting implemented for performance metrics.

*Rationale: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and system scalability, critical factors for hackathon evaluation.*

### V. Documentation & Maintainability
All APIs MUST have OpenAPI specifications. Code MUST be self-documenting with clear variable names and minimal comments. Architecture decisions MUST be documented in ADRs. Setup and deployment procedures MUST be automated and documented.

*Rationale: Clear documentation enables rapid onboarding and reduces knowledge silos during intensive hackathon development.*

## Quality Gates

All features MUST pass the following gates before completion:
- Static analysis passes without warnings
- All tests pass with minimum 80% coverage
- Performance benchmarks meet defined thresholds
- Security scan passes without critical issues
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- UX review confirms consistency with design system

Code deployment is blocked if any quality gate fails. No exceptions without explicit architectural justification documented in Complexity Tracking.

## Development Workflow

Code changes follow trunk-based development with feature flags for incomplete work. All commits MUST be atomic and follow conventional commit format. Pull requests require approval from at least one team member and automated CI checks must pass. Database migrations MUST be backward compatible and tested in staging environment.

Continuous integration pipeline enforces all quality standards automatically. Manual quality gate bypasses require team consensus and documented justification.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. Amendments require team consensus, documentation of impact, and migration plan for existing code. All code reviews and development decisions MUST verify constitutional compliance.

Complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with specific business need and simpler alternatives documented as rejected. Emergency exceptions require post-incident review and remediation plan.
