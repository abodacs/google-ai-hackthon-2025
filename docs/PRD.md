### **Version 1.0: Foundational Assessment**
This version focuses on establishing the core loop of content input and comprehension assessment, providing immediate value by transforming any text into a practice quiz.

#### **Feature 1.1: Content Input and Preference Selection**
*   **Description:** Users can paste any text into the application. Before processing, they must select their grade level (1-12, Undergrad) and can optionally select interests from a predefined list of 16 categories.
*   **Business Justification:** This is the entry point to the user journey and the foundation of all personalization, directly supporting the "Personalized Learning Paths" and "Clear Target Market" value propositions.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to paste text from any source so that I can start learning immediately.
    *   As a student, I must select my grade level so that the generated content is at the right difficulty for me.
    *   As a learner, I want to select my interests (e.g., "video games," "space exploration") so that the material can be made more relatable to me in future versions.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   The application must feature a text area for content input (e.g., min 200 characters, max 2,000 characters).
    *   A mandatory grade level selector must be present.
    *   An optional multi-select interface for the 16 interest categories shall be provided.
    *   The application must store these preferences for the duration of the learning session.

#### **Feature 1.2: Section-Adaptive Bloom's Taxonomy Quizzes**

*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a student, after submitting a text, I want a quiz to be generated so I can test my understanding of the material.
    *   As a learner, I want to see if my answer is right or wrong immediately, along with a brief explanation and a reference to the source text.
    *   As High School Henry, I want questions that make me think critically (apply, analyze), not just recall facts.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   The AI must parse the input text and generate a quiz of at least 5 questions.
    *   Each question must have 3-4 possible answers, with one correct answer.
    *   The system will provide instant feedback upon answer selection.

This version introduces a visual learning tool to help users see the structure of the information, catering to diverse learning styles.

#### **Feature 2.1: Interactive Mind Map Generation**
*   **Description:** A "Mindmap" viewing mode will be available on the learning dashboard. The AI will analyze the input text and generate a hierarchical mind map of the core concepts, main ideas, and supporting details.
*   **Business Justification:** This adds a powerful visual component to the "Personalized Learning Paths," directly addressing the need for multi-modal content. It is a key differentiator that appeals strongly to visual learners, broadening the platform's user base.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a visual learner, I want to see the main topics of my text organized in a mind map so I can understand the relationships between them.
    *   As a student studying for a test, I want to be able to zoom in on a specific branch of the mind map to review details for that sub-topic.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to click on a node in the mind map and see the corresponding section of the original text highlighted.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   The AI must identify the central theme, main branches, and sub-branches from the text.
    *   The mind map must be rendered graphically on an interactive canvas.

*   **Business Justification:** This feature further diversifies the "Personalized Learning Paths" by catering to auditory learners. It represents a significant step towards a more interactive and conversational learning experience, enhancing user engagement.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an auditory learner, I want to talk about what I've learned to solidify my understanding.
    *   As a student, I want to record my summary of a topic and have an AI teacher tell me if I missed any key points.
    *   As a user who is multitasking, I want to be able to listen to a lesson and interact with it using my voice.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   The platform must use the browser's microphone to capture user speech.

### **Version 4.0: Deep Immersion and Content Augmentation**
This version focuses on making the core reading experience itself more active, personalized, and seamless.

#### **Feature 4.1: PDF Document Upload**
*   **Description:** In addition to pasting text, users will be able to upload documents (initially PDF only). The system will extract the text from the document for processing.
*   **Business Justification:** This dramatically improves usability and workflow, allowing users to work directly with their course materials (e.g., lecture notes, academic articles) without a copy-paste step, thereby removing a key friction point.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As College Chloe, I want to upload the PDF of a research paper so I can quickly generate a summary and quiz.
    *   As a user, I want a simple "upload" button on the homepage so I can easily select a file from my computer.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   An upload interface for PDF files shall be provided.
    *   Text extraction from the uploaded PDF must occur entirely on the client-side for privacy.
    *   The extracted text should be passed to the same processing pipeline as pasted text.
    *   The system must provide clear error handling for corrupted or unreadable PDFs.

#### **Feature 4.2: Immersive Text with Embedded Questions & Personalization**
*   **Description:** This feature enhances the primary reading view. The AI will rewrite the material to incorporate the user's selected interests and embed interactive questions directly within the text.
*   **Business Justification:** This is the pinnacle of the "AI-Powered Content," "Personalized Learning Paths," and "Enhanced Engagement" value propositions. It transforms the text from a static block into a dynamic, personalized dialogue that actively pulls the learner through the material.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As Middle School Maya (6th grader interested in video games), I want my text about historical trade routes to use analogies from game worlds to help me understand the concepts.
    *   As I read a paragraph, I want a question to appear right after it to check if I understood that specific section before moving on.
    *   As a learner, I want to answer the embedded question and get immediate feedback without leaving the reading view.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   The AI must be able to identify key concepts that can be linked to the user's selected interests.
    *   The system must rewrite sections of the text to include personalized analogies or examples.
    *   The AI must generate short, contextual questions linked to specific sentences or paragraphs.
    *   These questions must be seamlessly embedded within the rendered text, using an efficient markdown renderer (e.g., `react-streamdown`) to handle dynamic insertion.
    *   The interface for answering these questions must be non-intrusive (e.g., an inline form).

**5. Out of Scope for these Versions**
*   Narrated slides with fill-in-the-blanks.
*   User accounts and saving of learning sessions across devices.
*   Multiplayer or collaboration features.
*   Teacher/Administrator dashboards.
